# Crime-Rate-Analysis-for-Baltimore-City
### Analyzing Neighborhood Crime Trends Using Python and Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project investigates crime patterns in Baltimore City for the years 2017 and 2024, focusing on correlations between 311 service requests and violent crime rates. The goal is to provide actionable insights for policymakers and urban planners to improve neighborhood safety and allocate resources effectively.
